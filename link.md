I find it very interesting listening to them. Some may view it as "<b>Oral history in Genetics</b>".The below text summarizes why it is made for.<br> 
"Conversations in Genetics was initiated in 1997 by Rochelle Easton Esposito, under the auspices of the the Genetics Society of America, to record the thoughts and feelings of prominent scientists as they describe their research accomplishments and recall the paths taken during various phases of their lives that led to their work".<br><br>
