  <p> This website was built mainly to describe my research profile to the interested people. Please go to the 
  respective sections to know more about my research and myself. On <a href="research">Research</a> page, I provided a link where I tried to describe my 
  research works in relatively plain english that aimed at people who come from different background than biology.<br> 
          
<p> Currently I am working as a Cancerfonden postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Ruth Palmer lab at Gothenburg University, Sweden. My on-going work focuses on 
 cancer biology, more specifically in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that accounts for 15% of childhood cancer 
  mortality. It is a disease which arises from the sympathetic nervous system. Our aim is to understand the key events that 
  drive the neuroblastoma in mouse and Drosophila models at single cell resolution and provide therapeutics to combat this disease. <br>
