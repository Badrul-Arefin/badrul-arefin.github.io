 <i><b>Hello, Welcome to my personal website!</b></i><br><br> 
  
  <p> This website was built mainly to describe my research profile to the like minded and interested people. Please go to the 
  respective sections to know more about my research and myself. In <a href="about">About</a> page, I tried to describe my 
  research works in relatively plain english that aimed at people who came from different background than biology.<br> 
  
       
<p> By the way, My name is Badrul Arefin, a postdoctoral fellow at the university of Gothenburg, Sweden. Currently I am working 
  in cancer biology, more specifically in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that accounts for 15% of childhood cancer 
  mortality. It is a disease which arises from the sympatatic nervous system. Our aim is to understand the key events that 
  drive the neuroblastoma in mouse and Drosophila models at single cell resolution.<br>

  Cancerfonden</a> granted 7 applications (out of 57) for 3 years postdoctoral research, fortunately my application was one 
  of them! Very thankful to Cancerfonden, my supervisors and the respective labs!
