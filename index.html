  <p> This website was built mainly to describe my research profile to the like-minded and interested people. Please go to the 
  respective sections to know more about my research and myself. In <a href="research">Research</a> page, I provided a link where I tried to describe my 
  research works in relatively plain english that aimed at people who came from different background than biology.<br> 
          
<p> By the way, My name is Badrul Arefin, a postdoctoral fellow at the university of Gothenburg, Sweden. Currently I am working 
  in cancer biology, more specifically in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that accounts for 15% of childhood cancer 
  mortality. It is a disease which arises from the sympathetic nervous system. Our aim is to understand the key events that 
  drive the neuroblastoma in mouse and Drosophila models at single cell resolution.<br>
