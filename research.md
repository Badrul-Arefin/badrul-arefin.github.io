For the last 10+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics,
innate immunity and cancer. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be trained in different leading labs in Sweden, 3 of my supervisors were awarded Göran Gustafsson Prize in molecular biology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for their outstanding scientific output. Therefore, I considered my training was rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I belive I am a curiocity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 10+ publications, among them I was the 1st author for 6 papers, which helped me to sustain in academic research so far. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors and the restective labs. Without their incredible contribution, I woulbe be nowhere in science!

My full time research started in Sweden in the summer of 2009, when I got a chance to develop a new tool for chromosomal integration into the yeast S. cerevisiae. We all know by now that our life (multicellular organisms) begins from a single cell. So I was puzzled how a single cell turns into multicellular organism that led me into development biology. My first work in developmental biology was focused in the very early stage of the Drosophila embryo which is within several hours after fertifilization. 



- Highly skilled in molecular and genetic methods, large scale data analysis, microscopy and image
processing.
- Presented my research in several international platforms both orally, and by poster format.
- Taught courses in both bachelor and master level, and supervised students at Stockholm
University.
- Published several peer-reviewed research articles in international journals, 6 of them as 1st author.

Brief description:
In developmental biology, I investigated how mRNA transport along microtubule to form a gradient, together with the quest for a function of a Bicoid isoform, using different genetic and molecular approaches. Later, I focused in tracheal (respiratory organ) development. Both works were involved in embryonic stages.

My PhD thesis project was to decipher the molecular mechanism of the Drosophila responses towards nematodes. In addition, I investigated the Drosophila immune reactions in cancer.

Postdoc project title:
1. The Notch signalling in the central nervous system (CNS) development.
2. Characterizing the stabilized version of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo and human p21 in the developing nervous system.
