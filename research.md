<h2>In brief</h2>

<b> 2nd Postdoc research</b><br> 
Compresensive single cell analysis and functional validation of ALK-driven neuroblastoma models. I added little description regarding my work on the home page, so please see there. <a href="https://badrul-arefin.github.io/">Link</a> <br>Supervisor: Prof. Ruth Palmer, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Sweden. <br>


<b> 1st Postdoc research</b><br> 
To unravel the molecular network that orchestrates the central nervous system (CNS) formation during embryogenesis. I was involved in a set of studies that take a comprehensive molecular and genetic approach aimed at understanding the connection between Notch and proliferation control in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). More will be added later...

- The Notch signalling in the central nervous system (CNS) development. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825841">Link</a> <br>
- Characterizing the stabilized version of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo and human p21 in the developing nervous system. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289041">Link</a><br>Supervisor: Prof. Stefan Thor, Link√∂ping University, Sweden.


<b>PhD research</b><br>
