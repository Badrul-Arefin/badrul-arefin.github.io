<h2>In brief</h2>

<b> 1st Postdoc research</b><br> 
To unravel the molecular network that orchestrates the central nervous system (CNS) formation during embryogenesis. I was involved in a set of studies that take a comprehensive molecular and genetic approach aimed at understanding the connection between Notch and proliferation control in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). More will be added later...
<br>
- The Notch signalling in the central nervous system (CNS) development.<br>
- Characterizing the stabilized version of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo and human p21 in the developing nervous system.
<br>Supervisor: Prof. Stefan Thor, Link√∂ping University, Sweden.


<b>PhD research</b><br>
- Molecular characterization of the Drosophila responses towards nematodes.<br>Supervisor: Prof. Ulrich Theopold, Stockholm University, Sweden.<br> To know more, please click here <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/badrularefin/research">here.</a><br>

<b>Licentiate thesis</b><br>
- The Drosophila defense towards nematodes and the contribution of danger signals. 
<br>Supervisor: Prof. Ulrich Theopold.


<b>Stipend project</b><br> 
- Identification of apical secretion pathways in epithelial tube morphogenesis.
<br> Supervisor: Prof. Christos Samakovlis, Developmental Biology, Stockholm University. 

<b>Master Thesis</b><br> 
- Analysis of the mechanism of bicoid mRNA transport and the function of a Bicoid isoform. 
<br> Supervisor: Prof. Stefan Baumgartner, Developmental Biology, Lund University, Sweden.
