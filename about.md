For the last 10+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity and cancer. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be trained in different leading labs in Sweden, 3 of my supervisors were awarded GÃ¶ran Gustafsson Prize in molecular biology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for their outstanding scientific output. Therefore, I considered my training was rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I belive I am a curiocity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 10+ publications, among them I was the 1st author for 6 papers, which helped me to sustain in academic research so far. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors and the restective labs. Without their incredible contribution, I woulbe be nowhere in science!

My full time research started in Sweden in the summer of 2009, when I got a chance to develop a new tool for chromosomal integration into the yeast S. cerevisiae. We all know by now that our life (multicellular organisms) begins from a single cell. So I was puzzled how a single cell turns into multicellular organism that led me into development biology. My first work in developmental biology was focused in the very early stage of the Drosophila embryo which is within several hours after fertifilization. One of the questions was how the intial genes are expressed. Afterwards, my rsearch was centered around how our respiratory system (trachea) was formed in embryogenesis.
