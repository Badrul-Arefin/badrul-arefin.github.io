For the last 10+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity and cancer. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be trained in different leading labs in Sweden where 3 of my supervisors were awarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ran_Gustafsson_Prize">GÃ¶ran Gustafsson Prize</a> in molecular biology from the <a href="https://kva.se/sv/priser/goran-gustafssonprisen">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </a> for their outstanding scientific output. Moreover, my PhD and postdoc times were very rewarding in terms of diversity of the projects, scientific output and exposed to lots of teaching, thanks to my great PhD and postdoc supervisors. Therefore, I consider my training is rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I believe I am a curiosity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 10+ publications, among them I am the 1st author for 6 original research articles. Despite not having a connection with my research, Prof. Edgar Pera helped me   enormously over the years and still doing so to reach my goals. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors, mentors and the colleagues for their incredible contribution!<br><br>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<ul>
<li> I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I moved to Sweden in Aug. 2008 to pursue master studies in Biotechnology. Throughout my life, I am/was incredibly well supported by the family and friends, so grateful to them! Normally I try to be active physically, so I go for running 2-3 times a week or do some cross-training exercises. In my spare time, I spend time reading newspaper and watching fun stuffs in the internet.
