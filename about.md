For the last 10+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity and cancer. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be trained in different leading labs in Sweden where my supervisors are members of the <a href="https://kva.se/sv/priser/goran-gustafssonprisen">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </a> and were awarded different major prizes. For instance, 3 of my supervisors were awarded prizes including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ran_Gustafsson_Prize">GÃ¶ran Gustafsson Prize</a> in molecular biology from the <a href="https://kva.se/sv/priser/goran-gustafssonprisen">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </a> for their outstanding scientific output. Moreover, my PhD and postdoc times were very rewarding in terms of diversity of the projects, scientific output and I was exposed to lots of teaching, thanks to my great PhD and postdoc supervisors. Recently I received 2 postdoctoral grants from <a href="https://www.cancerfonden.se/forskning/for-forskare/samtliga-anslagsbeslut"> Cancerfonden </a> (Swedish Cancer Foundation) and <a href="https://www.barncancerfonden.se/for-forskare/forskningsanslag/beviljade-forskningsanslag-och-tjanster/"> Barncancerfonden </a> (Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation) for 3 and 2 years respectively. Therefore, I consider my training is rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I believe I am a curiosity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 10+ publications, among them I am the 1st author for 6 original research articles. In addition to these, my scientitifc career is/was benefited enormously by Prof. Edgar Pera over the years to reach my goals, although he was not connected with my research. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors, mentors and the colleagues for their incredible contribution! Finally my goal is to grow continuously as a scientist and become a better human being. <br><br>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<ul>
<li> I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I moved to Sweden in Aug. 2008 to pursue master studies in Biotechnology. Throughout my life, I am/was incredibly well supported by the family and friends, so grateful to them! Normally I try to be active physically, so I go for running 2-3 times a week or do some cross-training exercises. In my spare time, I spend time reading newspaper and watching fun stuffs in the internet.
