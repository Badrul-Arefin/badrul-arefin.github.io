For the last 10+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity and cancer. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to be trained in different leading labs in Sweden where 3 of my supervisors were awarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ran_Gustafsson_Prize">GÃ¶ran Gustafsson Prize</a> in molecular biology from the <a href="https://kva.se/sv/priser/goran-gustafssonprisen">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </a> for their outstanding scientific output. Therefore, I consider my training is rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I believe I am a curiosity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 10+ publications, among them I was the 1st author for 6 original research articles, which helped me to sustain in academic research so far. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors and the restective labs for their incredible contribution!<br><br>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<ul>
<li> I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I moved to Sweden in Aug. 2008 to pursue master studies in Biotechnology. Normally I try to be active physically, so I go for running 2-3 times a week or do some cross-training exercises. In my spare time, I spend time reading newspaper and watching fun stuffs in the internet.
