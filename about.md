For the last 11+ years, my research revolves around different areas namely molecular and developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity and cancer. Initially it was started with a model organism <i> S. cerevsiae </i> (yeast) for a summer project. Then <i> Drosophila melanoagaster </i> (fruit-fly) became the central model organism for my research until now along with mouse models. In <i> Drosophila </i>, I worked in all stages, but extensively in embryonic and larval stages for the developmental biology and insect immunity  projects respectively. Mouse model is being used in cancer projects.

When I reflect on my research, I consider my PhD and postdoc times were very rewarding in terms of diversity of the projects, scientific output and I was exposed to lots of teaching, thanks to my great PhD and postdoc supervisors. I received 2 postdoctoral grants from <a href="https://www.cancerfonden.se/forskning/for-forskare/samtliga-anslagsbeslut"> Cancerfonden </a> (Swedish Cancer Foundation) and <a href="https://www.barncancerfonden.se/for-forskare/forskningsanslag/beviljade-forskningsanslag-och-tjanster/"> Barncancerfonden </a> (Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation) for 3 and 2 years respectively.

Therefore, I tend to think that my training is rigorous enough to push the science forward. In addition, I believe I am a curiosity-driven person and very passionate about research. I really love working in the lab. Along the way, I got 12+ publications, among them I am the 1st author for 6 original research articles. In addition to these, my scientitifc career is/was benefited enormously by Prof. Edgar Pera over the years to reach my goals, although he was not connected with my research. Therefore I am very much thankful to my supervisors, mentors and the colleagues for their incredible contribution! Finally my goal is to grow continuously as a scientist and become a better human being. <br><br>
My motto: <i>"Let's be kind, generous and uplift others".</i><br><br>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<ul>
<li> I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I moved to Sweden in Aug. 2008 to pursue master studies in Biotechnology. Throughout my life, I am/was incredibly well supported by the family and friends, so grateful to them! Normally I try to be active physically, so I go for running 2-3 times a week or do some cross-training exercises. In my spare time, I spend time reading newspapers, watching fun stuffs in the internet and on Netflix, and with friends.
